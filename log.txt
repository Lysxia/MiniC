Questions :
- are successive identical declarations illegal ?
"int a; int a;" "int a; char* a;"
- do global variables reach before their declaration ?
"int main(){ ... a=0; ... } int a;"
- why is the testing instruction in a 'for' block optional when there is
  no break ?
"for (i=0;;i++)"
- aren't all pointers the same size ?
"sizeof(...***)"
