- 32 bits signed integers are not fully supported in lexer/parser.
  OCaml integers are 31 bits wide on 32 bit architectures,
  on 64b there is no problem however.

10/28
- Parsing errors probably should be taken care of inside parser.mly
    ...(*an error occurs*) print_err_loc location; raise Error;

- see utest/ctst.c for syntax details

- Arguments :
-- int, char, t* first in a0-a3 then stacked
-- struct and unions always stacked
- char c=255; c+1; second instruction will be defined behavior only mod 256
- int a; &a;
-- how to manage the address of a when a is allocated on a register ?
-- We DON'T. &a forces a to be on the stack

01/04
- 1/0 raises a div_by_zero error
-- Except when it is optimized out
- additions and substractions are taken mod 2^32 by gcc
- MIPS overflows are execution failures
-- Our compiler may erase such failures while partially
-- evaluating because OCaml Int32 module arithmetic is taken mod 2^32
-- and whoever wants to use those errors effectively in their program
-- is an idiot or just weird because that's MiniC,
-- something that exists only at the ENS.
--- OR WE COULD USE UNSIGNED ADD / SUB WITHOUT OVERFLOW
--- subu is just sub but no overflow

- MIN_INT/-1 give 0 by gcc, MIN_INT by MIPS divider

- MIPS div and rem as pseudo-instr use
- the same basic instr div then just pick quotient or remainder
- That could be implemented during instruction selection by adding
- mflo (quo) and mfhi (div) as instructions

- use sltu to check equal to zero and to transform into a boolean
- we could optimize using only basic instructions but its long and complicated

- seq is NOT optimal through MARS

- We will try to use basic ops for boolean operations

- unsigned comparison seems promising

01/05
- build RTL in SSA form is more efficient
- Bad idea because of dereferencing

01/06
- we arent going to do something tidy with char,
- a char value is to be taken mod 256 and its value when interpreted as an int means nothing
- this is coherent with the print char syscall (11) but not how gcc handles c+c'
#- we do not need stack pointers in MiniC because there aren't any
#-- local variables with dynamic sizes.
#-- (parameters are considered local to the caller function)
#-- I keep $sp though we don't need it, for minimal readability.
#- In short, we aren't going to do something tidy at all.
#- But it will be KOMPAKT
- No in fact what we don't need is $fp,
- because frame size is constant as stated above
- So we do without fp because this time it seems more natural

- And we give up optimizing through basic opts though it's quite feasible.

- final calls will be handled in any case

- Caller-saved registers more finely handled

- WELL NO I DONT DO ANYTHING BECAUSE OF DEREFERENCING
